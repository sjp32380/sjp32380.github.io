<P style="font-size:15px">After 49 years, the Chicago Blackhawks broke their Stanley Cup drought by winning the 2010 championship. This then led to two more Stanley Cup appearances and victories in 2013 and 2015. This recent Blackhawks team is considered by many to be a dynasty and one of the more dominant teams of all time. I have been a Blackhawks fan my whole life and so is my dad. The only difference between our fandom is that he had been waiting decades to see the Hawks win the cup and I had only been waiting 12 years. Either way, the victory led to an overall better mood in the city of Chicago that unified and strengthened the community. As if the 2010 win wasnt enough, the two more championships that followed in the years to come electrified every fan. Being the fan of the best team in the National Hockey League is a lot of fun especially since other fans are jealous of my teams good fortune. Hopefully the Blackhawks can continue their dominance and win the Stanley Cup in years to come!</P>
